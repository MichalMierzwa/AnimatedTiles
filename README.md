# AnimatedTiles
Project made using Qt 5.4 only for educational purpose. List of things I achieved so far:

1) 100 tiles (10x10) shows asynchronously, 10 colours x 10 tiles (random color placement)
2) Possibility to scroll down the screen.
3) Clicked tile grows bigger.
4) Clicking again on the enlarged one removes the effect, clicking on another one enlarge it.
5) Clicked tile has list of all 10 colours.
6) After clicking on chosen colour tiles form a row through animation, rest disappears. Clicking on the blank spot switch back to previous setup.
7) Holding down the tile starts shaking, after x time it starts a movie player.
8) Chosen movie file can be played in loop.
9) The colours on the tiles may be randomized from json file.
